This repository contains an example of a SQL injection vulnerability in a stored procedure and its solution. The vulnerable stored procedure constructs a dynamic SQL query using user input without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code and potentially gain unauthorized access to the database. The solution demonstrates how to prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries or stored procedure parameters.
